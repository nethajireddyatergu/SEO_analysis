She was able to work with a diverse group of stakeholders who often did not share her area of expertise. She took a good collectivistic view of the team, the team outcomes, and the entire effort. She came up out of her silo, you might call it, her own little area of expertise in jargon,\n",
    "and she learned how to talk to everybody. We probably all know people who do the opposite. They are too individualistic and only concerned about their own tasks and their own individual projects. But if you want high marks for soft skills, then working with other people on a team is really critical. Number six is problem solving. I was talking to a friend of mine the other day. He works behind the scenes in television and he said that his job is essentially solving one problem after the next all day long.\n",
    "They start with a plan, but there's never enough money or help, and there's always obstacles they didn't see coming. And our ability to find a way to move forward and solve those problems is really important. Problem solving usually involves critical thinking, logical reasoning, and we have to have the ability to think through an issue clearly and reasonably. Problem solving also involves making good decisions, informed decisions. We can't just do what we feel like doing. We have to come up with a solution\n",
    "that actually is going to work, not just the first idea that comes to mind or just go with our favorite way of doing things. And that takes preparation and a systematic approach, research, creativity, and a good dose of personal resourcefulness. Number seven is flexibility and adaptability. Most of us work on a variety of tasks with all sorts of different people. And that means we have to be flexible and open to change and find new ways of doing things oftentimes, and this is really hard for some people.\n",
    "I worked with a client for a while who is very inflexible. And once she got an idea in her head, she would protect it and she would shoot down any other suggestions. Well, that's not a good example of soft skills. We need to have the self-awareness to realize that we have our own personality quirks, our own mental boxes, and we have to do our best to put that aside. We have to get better at adapting to others and responding to uncertainty and change with flexibility. And that means at times to be open, trainable,\n",
    "and work well under pressure on deadlines, and somehow still get described as someone who is easy to work with. We have to learn how to roll with changes and keep moving forward even when the situation is ambiguous. Number eight is our ability to manage and resolve conflict and even negotiate a little bit. And this begins, of course, by being the kind of person who does not create conflict. I honestly believe that when people say they're looking for someone with good conflict management skills,\n",
    "that's another way to say, we don't want someone who is going to cause conflict, who has a tendency to create drama. And you can usually tell because this type of person has a win-lose philosophy. In order for them to win, somebody else must lose. So they act competitive in times and in places where it's not necessary at all. In my experience, people with a win-lose or conflict-driven approach usually brought that with them from their own personal life and they brought it into the workplace. They are like that every place they work, in other words,\n",
    "and you don't want to be this person. So first don't be a source of conflict. And next, when conflict comes up between you and others around you, learn to deal with it appropriately and productively. That means looking for common ground, finding ways to get everybody's interests met, and somehow using a disagreement to make things even better in the end. And this might mean drawing on negotiation skills or facilitation skills to hear everybody out, make sure everybody feels understood. You want to take a win-win approach\n",
    "and look for a satisfactory outcome for everybody involved, not just you. It often means being the bigger person, the more mature person, in other words. Question of the day.

    "text = \"\"\"These are the basics, and I think what they're really asking about is the work ethic and self motivation. Employers don't want to hire people they have to micromanage and wonder if they're going to be working hard. Number five is teamwork. And again, this is another big word that can certainly include many of the skills we've already mentioned. But specifically, teamwork often means our ability to collaborate work cooperatively with others on joint projects. Part of teamwork is knowing how to connect\n",
    "and put your heads together with other people on your actual team and also work with people in other departments in larger organizations. I'm thinking of a boss, a former supervisor I used to work for, who had very high marks on teamwork. She was able to work with a diverse group of stakeholders who often did not share her area of expertise. She took a good collectivistic view of the team, the team outcomes, and the entire effort. She came up out of her silo, you might call it, her own little area of expertise in jargon,\n",
    "and she learned how to talk to everybody. We probably all know people who do the opposite. They are too individualistic and only concerned about their own tasks and their own individual projects. But if you want high marks for soft skills, then working with other people on a team is really critical. Number six is problem solving. I was talking to a friend of mine the other day. He works behind the scenes in television and he said that his job is essentially solving one problem after the next all day long.\n",
    "They start with a plan, but there's never enough money or help, and there's always obstacles they didn't see coming. And our ability to find a way to move forward and solve those problems is really important. Problem solving usually involves critical thinking, logical reasoning, and we have to have the ability to think through an issue clearly and reasonably. Problem solving also involves making good decisions, informed decisions. We can't just do what we feel like doing. We have to come up with a solution\n",
    "that actually is going to work, not just the first idea that comes to mind or just go with our favorite way of doing things. And that takes preparation and a systematic approach, research, creativity, and a good dose of personal resourcefulness. Number seven is flexibility and adaptability. Most of us work on a variety of tasks with all sorts of different people. And that means we have to be flexible and open to change and find new ways of doing things oftentimes, and this is really hard for some people.\n",
    "I worked with a client for a while who is very inflexible. And once she got an idea in her head, she would protect it and she would shoot down any other suggestions. Well, that's not a good example of soft skills. We need to have the self-awareness to realize that we have our own personality quirks, our own mental boxes, and we have to do our best to put that aside. We have to get better at adapting to others and responding to uncertainty and change with flexibility. And that means at times to be open, trainable,\n",
    "and work well under pressure on deadlines, and somehow still get described as someone who is easy to work with. We have to learn how to roll with changes and keep moving forward even when the situation is ambiguous. Number eight is our ability to manage and resolve conflict and even negotiate a little bit. And this begins, of course, by being the kind of person who does not create conflict. I honestly believe that when people say they're looking for someone with good conflict management skills,\n",
    "that's another way to say, we don't want someone who is going to cause conflict, who has a tendency to create drama. And you can usually tell because this type of person has a win-lose philosophy. In order for them to win, somebody else must lose. So they act competitive in times and in places where it's not necessary at all. In my experience, people with a win-lose or conflict-driven approach usually brought that with them from their own personal life and they brought it into the workplace. They are like that every place they work, in other words,\n",
    "and you don't want to be this person. So first don't be a source of conflict. And next, when conflict comes up between you and others around you, learn to deal with it appropriately and productively. That means looking for common ground, finding ways to get everybody's interests met, and somehow using a disagreement to make things even better in the end. And this might mean drawing on negotiation skills or facilitation skills to hear everybody out, make sure everybody feels understood. You want to take a win-win approach\n",
    "and look for a satisfactory outcome for everybody involved, not just you. It often means being the bigger person, the more mature person, in other words. Question of the day. Which of these top eight soft skills do you need the most work on personally? And feel free to check out my free download of the five essential communication skills that every professional should have. And there's always a free class at my Communication Coach Academy.
